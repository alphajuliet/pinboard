# pinboard

Code to read in a Pinboard JSON export, convert it to an Ubergraph graph, and export to GraphML for visualisation.

The graph is set up with all bookmarks and tags as nodes, and edges connecting each bookmark to each of its tags.

The GraphML can be read into [Gephi](https://www.gephi.com/), for example, 
and have a layout applied to it, and formatters to highlight the highest degree nodes.

## Usage

See the code in `src/pinboard/core.clj`.
